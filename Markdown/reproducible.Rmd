# Reproducible programming

## General rules

- the scripts should be written in a way, that either you, or someone else will be able to run it anytime.
- Clean structure, accordig to the best programming practices
- comment your codes in detail
- Use sessionInfo() to know your package versions
- Use as generalized code as possible - use names and regular expressions instead of indices. 
- if possible, define your paths at the beginning and use paste() or file.path() later. 
- try to do everything from R, because changes in e.g. excel are undocumented.

## Use version control

- git is an easy tool to do version control.

```{r}

```


## Rmarkdown, R notebooks

- Rmarkdown document, with code chuncks
- Markdown language is easy to learn, see the cheatsheat
- many templates available - flexible themes
- Description, codes and figures at the same place. 
- Figures are saved separately as well.
- Appearance of the code depends on the chunk options.

Show code and output

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Show only output

```{r echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Show code only, don't run

```{r eval=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

- Suppress warnings and messages, if needed.
- Use cheatsheets
- easy to add pictures, links, etc.
- easy to add nice tables

```{r, results='asis'}
library(dplyr)
data("mtcars")
knitr::kable(mtcars, format = "html")
print(xtable::xtable(mtcars), type = 'html')

 mtcars %>%
 	DT::datatable(filter = 'top', 
          options = list(scrollX = TRUE, keys = TRUE, pageLength = 5),  
          rownames = FALSE)



```


## workflowr package
- does the above steps automatically
- keeps a nice folder structure
- easy to use git 


# Exercises:

- set up git with Rstudio
- set up your github account with workflowr
- create a new project using wflow_start()
- create a new markdown file in the analysis folder, my_first_project
- using TCGAbiolinks, download clinical data for TCGA-LUAD
<https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/TCGAbiolinks/inst/doc/clinical.html#clinical_indexed_data>
- delete empty columns using a for cycle and if statements. 
- modify days since birth that it appears in years. google the exact number of days in a year. 
- Create tables for age, gender, race and stage
- do chi-sq test for stage and gender. Plot the data (e.g. barplot, counts by gender)
- do linear regression for the smoking related variables and stage, gender and age. show the results in table. Plot the data.
- do survival analysis on the data for stages and for gender
<https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/TCGAbiolinks/inst/doc/analysis.html#tcgaanalyze_survival:_survival_analysis>
- Add code_hero_rstats.png to the end of your report (pictures) folder.
