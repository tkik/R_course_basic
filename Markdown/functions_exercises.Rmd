1. Write a function that divides two numbers. If the divider is zero, it shouldn't try the division, but give a message about it. 

```{r}

```


2. Write a function that changes all vowels of a string to e-s.

```{r}

```


3. Add a checking part, that checks if the input is indeed one character and it has vowels in it. If not, it should give a message. 

```{r}

```

4.  Write a fucntion that calculates the variance of a vector.

$$Var(x)=\frac n{n-1}\sum_{n=1}^{x} (x_{1}-\overline{x})^2$$
where 
$$\overline{x}=\frac{\sum_{i}^{n}x_{i}}n$$
```{r}

```


5. Add the respective checking codes. 

```{r}

```

6. Add a warning, if the class of the input vector is not numeric, but can be coarced as one. 

```{r}

```

7. Add errors is the checking codes fail. 

```{r}

```
